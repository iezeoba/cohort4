# ============== What is it ========================-
# pipenv is a virtual environment manager. It helps developers and
# manage their code in a virtual environment.

# =============== Why you should use it ================= -
# it helps developers easily manage dependencies and installed packages local
# to a particular app and helps in version control as well.

# ============== What are some best practices ===================
# sure to cd into the fcorrect file directory before running the pipenv shell
# when pipenv is created, a pipfile is generated automatically which manages the packages and dependencies for the project
#

# ===========What are the commands===================
# pip install pipenv // install pipenv // pip installs pipenv
# pipenv --python python3.6 // use the python version you want to associate with the pipenv
# pipenv shell //enter the virtual environment
# pipenv install // update all packages and dependencies // pipenv installs or updates packages and dependencies 
# pipenv shell launches a virtual environment for each project
# use deactivate command to quit the pipenv, I think exit command also aborts the session
